## Oxomium

Oxomium has been disigned to help cybersecuirty team to handle the conformity of Organizations to standard or internal policy.
It has been design to be simple to use and avoid compex spreadsheet. 

Oxomium is provided with a basic set of features at firest but will be extanded with time. 

The OpenSource oaspect is fondamental for me and will (I hop) help to improve the tool quickly with the feedback of several users. 

### Conformity management

Today, the tool is capable to help you to manage your conformity to a policy.
The policy could be a default one (ISO27001 and NIST are provided) or your own policy. 

### Roadmap

I have plan a road map to improve the tool progressibly. I will use the GitHub milstones to show the progress of the developement. 

The plan for the next vertion is the following:

1. Simple Conformity management with ISO27001 and NIST sample dataset.
2. Support of Action Plan 
3. Executive dashbord and email notification for deadline management
4. Security survey for external suplyer (with magic link)
5. Support of manual Indicator (KPI)
6. Support of automatic Indicator with automatic data gatering from API
